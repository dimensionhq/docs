Getting your first project up and running on Dimension is easy. In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to create a new project - **communication**, **code**, **cloud**, and more included.

<Note>
  This guide assumes you have an existing project or organization that you want
  to connect to Dimension. If you don't, you can create one by following the
  steps in the [Create a Project](/guides/create-a-project) guide.
</Note>

This guide will cover:

- [Signing In](#signing-in)
- [Creating a realm](#creating-a-realm)
- [Inviting team members](#inviting-team-members)
- [Connecting repositories](#connecting-repositories)
- [Connecting cloud services](#connecting-cloud-services)

## Signing In

To get started, you'll need to sign in to Dimension. Currently, we support GitHub as an identity provider, so you'll need to have a GitHub account to create an account.

<Tip>
  If you don't have a GitHub account, you can create one by visiting
  [GitHub](https://github.com/signup)
</Tip>

## Creating a realm

A realm is a shared workspace for collaboration within your team. Let's create a new realm for our project.

<Tip>
  You can also create a realm from your browser by visiting
  [realm.new](https://realm.new)
